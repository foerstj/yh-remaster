I think I have some yodeling knickknacks here somewhere; would you like to buy them?\n\nWhat are you looking at? Oh I am sorry, I must look a fright. I have been fighting a terrible cold this last week, and it has gotten the better of me.\n\nSo what was it you were looking for again? Oh yes, you were going to sell me a chalice or something. I've got plenty of coin to part with for that, to be sure. Plenty to sell. More to buy. Don't be shy. Step right up.";
