Well there's plenty of history here, to be sure.\n\nYesterhaven is about as old as these hills, but older still are our neighbors to the north and south. The Snow Queen lives in her crystal towers up on Wintershroud Peak to the north, where she brings us winter and rain. To the south, past the canyons, lies the volcano Underforge, where the Fire King reigns over the summer and warmth from his Citadel of Ash. And between 'em, east of here, is the Valley of the Dead, but we don't talk about that much. Nothing living can go there.\n\nAm I boring you, or should I go on?";

Sounded like all hell broke loose up there. Then it went quiet, and all of a sudden, we were hit with this storm. Never seen anything like it. Everything froze, cows scattered, and crops died; we were totally unprepared.\n\nCaptain Kellan took his best men to see the Snow Queen, but we haven't heard from him since.";
